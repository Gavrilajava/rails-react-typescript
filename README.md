# Rails with React and TypeScript
This repository contains a sample Rails application that uses React written in TypeScript. The application was built as an experiment to demonstrate how to integrate React and TypeScript into a Rails app.

## Requirements
To run this application, you'll need to have the following installed on your system:

Ruby 3.1.1
Rails 7.0.4
Node.js
Yarn

## Installation
To get started with the application, follow these steps:

Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone`.
Install the required dependencies by running `bundle install` and `yarn install`.
Set up the database by running `rails db:create` and `rails db:migrate`.
Seed the database by running `rails db:seed`.
Start the server by running `rails server`.
Once the server is running, you can access the application by navigating to http://localhost:3000 in your web browser.

## Usage
The application displays a table of records retrieved from the database using React components written in TypeScript. You can experiment with the code by modifying the components or by adding your own data to the database.
